Neovim Win32 Distribution (completely unofficial)
-------------------------------------------------

https://github.com/joedrago/neovim-win32-dist

This awful pile of things is a quick attempt to see how large/possible a turnkey portable version of Neovim+Nyaovim could be.

I don't recommend using this repo or distribution in any way.
